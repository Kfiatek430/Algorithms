# **Algorithms Repository**

This repository contains a collection of various algorithms implemented in C++. It includes a range of fundamental algorithms for sorting, searching, number theory, cryptography, numerical methods, and text processing. The goal of this repository is to provide clear and efficient implementations of common algorithms, which can be used for educational purposes, performance analysis, or as building blocks for more complex projects.

### **Key Categories:**
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes well-known sorting methods such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bucket Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implements Binary Search and the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm.
- **Numerical Methods**: Algorithms like the Fast Exponentiation, Bisection Method, Newton's Method, and various numerical integration techniques (e.g., Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Method).
- **Number Theory**: Includes algorithms for prime factorization, prime testing (e.g., Miller-Rabin Primality Test), and Mersenne primes.
- **Cryptography**: Implements classical encryption algorithms like Caesar Cipher.
- **Text Processing**: Includes algorithms for calculating string distances such as Hamming and Levenshtein distance.
